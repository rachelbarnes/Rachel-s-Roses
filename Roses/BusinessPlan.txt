Tasks and Stories: 

Recipe Measurement Converter
	Get area of pans (circular, sqaure and rectangular pans) and be able to aggregate the volumes. 
	This will allow me to calculate the percent I need to convert the recipe based off of the original recipe's pan volume. If I am dealing with one of my cakes that does 2 8" round pans, I want to be able to calculate the multiplier for other pans. 
	I can do this either by converting all of the ingredients to tablespoons, knowing that it can be easier to deal with tablespoons, or I can do it by having 4 different sets of logic for when I calculate cups, tablespoons and teaspoons with the multiplier and measurement conversions. Along with this, if I am dealing with .125 cups, I would rather have this be 2 tablespoons. 
			I have already developed something to convert everything to tablespoons and it got dicey fast unfortunately. I would suggest having different logic that isn't so tightly coupled. It turned into tight coupling despite having TDD, or at least it got to the point that I didn't like the result. I'm going to try convering things in their own units of measurements, and I can just say, for example for cups, if a number is divisible by 16, 8, 4 and 2 to turn that into the respective 1, .5, .25 and .125 cups and go from there. 
	As soon as I can correctly convert all of my measurements, I can then use a percent calculator of the pan I'm using and the yielding pan of the original recipe and it will result in my multiplier for my recipe. 
			Thinking with this, I should be able to just have something that can give me the best measurement (as per example before, .125 cups is also 2 tablespoons, we just check to see if it is divisible by 8). 
	Major functionalities: 
		Percent calculator
		Volume aggregator
		Get varoius pan volumes
		Convert measurements to cups, tablespoons and teaspoons
		Multiply a recipe by a multiplier from the percent calculator concerning the desired pan and the regulatd yielding pan for that recipe. 
		Total cups used (translating from teaspoons and tablespoons) to allow for better lists for needed ingredients. 
	

Price Analysis and Evaluator
	Get the prices of individual ingredients as well as whole recipes. KNowing the individual prices allow better calculations for comparing different brands for ingredients and knowing which ingredients are the most costly. In my opinion, it can also allows an easier aggregator for the whole recipe. 
	Using a functionality of a price analysis opens the world of business in with baking and cake decorating. 
	For a profit calculator for paying workers, this is done by taking the money we made and subtracting the actual price of all the ingredients and materials. That difference is then calculated by however many workers there were. If there were 2 workers, we paid 350 for ingredients and we made 600, our profits/"wages" would be $125 a piece. 
	For a product price calculator, this is done by looking at the individual costs it takes to make the product and adding a profit to it (an 85% profit of a loaf of bread that costs $3.50 to make would be var Profit = 3.50*.85 and var Final Price = 3.50 + Profit. 
	A good idea for more introductions to "databases" is to load my profit/costs results into a database and whenever I go to check the aggregated cost and profit of a product, I could submit the data, run it against that which is in the database, and if it is the same, or within a 5% margin, I could return a bool that says true for whether or not we could use that price...

		Product price calculator


I wanted to do something with nutritional information, although this can be done afterwards. This can very easily be done online, and I will have already called plenty of Get Requests to walmart's database that I wouldn't be doing the nutritional information for necessarily more of the same introductory experience.
